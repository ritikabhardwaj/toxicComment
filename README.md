The proliferation of online discourse and messaging platforms in todayâ€™s society facilitates a need for moderation across these platforms for detecting and filtering out toxic and hateful messages. 

The toxic comment classification dataset is a large text corpus of Wikipedia talk page comments and requires preprocessing which is done using various NLP techniques along with undersampling and dimensionality reduction. Four different machine learning classification models are implemented which are ML-kNN, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier. Techniques such as binary relevance and classifier chains is used to facilitate multi-label toxicity classification. The performance of these models is evaluated using F1-score, with Logistic Regression outperforming all other models.
